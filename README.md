# Robospiel

Robospiel is a robotic glockenspiel. It is built from an Arduino Uno, some shift registers, some MOSFETs, some home-spun solenoids, and a glockenspiel.

There are a few different modules of code contained here:
- There is a standard "template" program which can have notes and timing manually entered in to play songs with after flashing to Robospiel.
- There is a MIDI translator/transposer utility which generates code that can be flashed to Robospiel that it can then play.
- There is a section devoted to my senior college thesis in which Robospiel was taught to use fast Fourier transform to listen to me play guitar melodies and chords and then play them back.

This is all very disorganized right now because I started this project 6 years ago and haven't touched it in about 3 years, and at that time I knew nothing of git so what I resorted to using as "source control" is now confusing me greatly. I hope to clean that up soon and also make this easier for other humans to pick up and play with.
